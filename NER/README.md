# Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) Models with spaCy

This repository contains two folders, `spacyv2` and `spacyv3`, each representing custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) models trained with different versions of spaCy. The NER models in both folders are designed to extract relevant information from OCR (Optical Character Recognition) data of various documents, including South African ID Cards, Passports, and Driver's Licenses, as well as documents from Zimbabwe and Kenya.
