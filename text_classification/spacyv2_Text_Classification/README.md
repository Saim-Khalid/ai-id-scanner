# Text Classification
This section focuses on the text classification model developed using spaCy v2.2.3 and Python 3.8. The trained model is designed to classify various types of identification documents commonly found in Southern Africa, including South African ID cards, driver's licenses, and passports, as well as documents from Zimbabwe and Kenya, such as Zimbabwean ID cards, driver's licenses, passports, and Kenyan ID cards and passports.
## Getting Started
To explore and utilize the text classification model, follow these steps:
- Clone the Repository: Begin by cloning this GitHub repository to your local machine.
- The text classification model is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook ([CardTextClassificationWithSpacy(MultiClasses_including_passports).ipynb](https://github.com/ioptime-official/ai-id-scanner/blob/main/text_classification/spacyv2_Text_Classification/CardTextClassificationWithSpacy(MultiClasses).ipynb)). Open this notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to access the code and detailed instructions.
- The Jupyter Notebook contains all the necessary requirements integrated into it. Make sure you have Python 3.8 installed along with the required libraries mentioned in the notebook.

## Features

## Model Usage
Follow the steps outlined in the Jupyter Notebook to load the trained model and classify text snippets or entire documents. The model is capable of distinguishing between South African, Zimbabwean, and Kenyan identification documents, categorizing them into relevant classes: ID card, driver's license, and passport.
