# Text Classification (SpaCyv3)
In this section, we present a text classification model trained using spaCy v3 to classify various types of identification documents. The model is designed to differentiate between different ID cards, driver's licenses, and passports from specific regions, including South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Kenya.
## Getting Started
To explore and utilize the text classification model, follow these steps:
- Clone the Repository: Begin by cloning this GitHub repository to your local machine.
- Training Code: The training code for the text classification model is available in the classification.py file. This script contains the implementation of the model training process.
- Testing: To evaluate the model's performance, you can use the test.py script. This script provides functionality to test the trained model on different samples.
- Data Preprocessing: Before training the model, the data needs to be preprocessed. The preprocess.py script takes care of data preprocessing tasks.

## Model Usage
Follow these steps to utilize the trained spaCy v3 text classification model:
-  Run the data preprocessing script (preprocess.py) to prepare the dataset for training.
- Execute the training code (classification.py) to train the text classification model using spaCy v3.
-  After training, you can use the test.py script to assess the model's performance on new samples.|
