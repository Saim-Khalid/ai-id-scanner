# Text Classification using SpaCy v2 and v3
Welcome to the Text Classification section of the AI ID Card Scanner, where we explore the implementation of text classification using two versions of spaCy: v2 and v3. This section aims to demonstrate how spaCy can be utilized to classify various types of identification documents from different regions, including South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Kenya.
## Scope and Purpose

The purpose of the text classification task in this repository is to automatically categorize identification documents text obtained from PaddleOCR into specific classes such as ID card, driver's license, and passport. This classification process serves several important purposes:

- *Automated Document Categorization:* The ability to automatically classify identification documents can significantly enhance data processing workflows. It allows for efficient organization and retrieval of documents based on their types.
- *Efficient Data Analysis:* By classifying documents, we can gain insights into the distribution of different identification document types within a dataset. This analysis is valuable to later use NER on the classififed string and  extract specific text from it.
- *Streamlining ID Verification:* Automated classification can aid in verifying the authenticity of identification documents. It provides a preliminary step in the verification process by identifying the type of document before further analysis.

In this repository the text classification is done using both versions of spacy which can be accessed from the following links:

- [Text Classification SpaCyv3](https://github.com/ioptime-official/ai-id-scanner/tree/main/text_classification/spacyv3_Text_Classification)
